# Poisonous-mushroom-detection
This project focuses to classify mushrooms using machine learning techniques into poisonous or non-poisonous based on their 22 features like color, shape, odor, and size. In addition to the domain knowledge, the data mining methods are used for selecting the important features that are correlation matrix and univariate feature selection on which it is noted that odor has a high beneficial importance value. Four machine learning algorithms are used for classification that are Random Forest tree, Decision tree, K-nearest neighbors, and Na√Øve Bayes out of which the Decision tree provides the highest accuracy of than other three models.
